Quarantine Crew presents a collection of their final remixed videos/songs here!

After several weeks of developing new skills, acquiring footage, and building up a concept, each member of **Quarantine Crew** is proud to present their final remixes.

# The Breakfast Club Rewind
## Ally Ephlin

A lot of teenagers across the world have had their high school experience affected by the national pandemic. I made this video to remind high schoolers that high school isn't over yet and we'll soon be back to our normal shenanigans again.

The idea of this beat was to create a tribute to the people who are still working to support our needs.

# Dababy - “Yea Yea”, featuring Drake (Official music video)
## Clinton Ellis

In recent rap music, rappers tend to use “yea” a lot in their music. So, I made a song with two popular rappers just saying “yea”.

# Corona Memes

My idea for this video was to make a song out of memes that started during the coronavirus.
